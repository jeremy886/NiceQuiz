# NiceQuiz - Project Design Brief

## **Background Information**

NiceQuiz is a **web-based quiz platform** designed to help teachers **create and deploy custom quizzes** in **classroom environments**. The platform allows educators to develop assessments for **any subject or topic** and students can complete these via a **simple web interface**. Teachers can monitor student progress in **real-time** and access results through **local server deployment** for **immediate classroom feedback**. The platform is designed to **simplify quiz administration** and provide teachers with **complete control over their assessment content**.

The system uses **Python with NiceGUI framework** for rapid development and integrates **hybrid session management** to track student progress without requiring user accounts. Students access quizzes by **entering their name** and completing **teacher-created assessments** with various question formats. The platform generates **immediate results** and allows teachers to **export student data** for grading and analysis. With **minimal technical setup** and **local deployment**, NiceQuiz is designed for **classroom use** and serves as a **teacher-controlled quiz solution**.

NiceQuiz addresses critical problems teachers face with existing quiz platforms:
- **Expensive subscription costs** that strain educational budgets
- **Platform shutdowns** causing sudden loss of quizzes and student data
- **Unexpected system changes** that disrupt established classroom workflows
- **Difficult data import/export** limiting teacher control over their content

NiceQuiz aims to solve these issues by providing **local deployment** with **complete teacher ownership**, **open architecture** for data portability, and **cost-free operation** that eliminates ongoing subscription dependencies.

As an **educational software platform**, NiceQuiz faces various **security and development challenges** typical of small-scale software projects including:
- **Data handling and privacy** considerations in educational environments
- **Session management security** across different devices and browsers
- **Development environment practices** for a single-developer project
- **Third-party dependency management** and potential vulnerabilities
- **Intellectual property** considerations for educational software
- **Compliance requirements** with educational data protection regulations

This represents a **case study in secure educational software development**, demonstrating **privacy-conscious design**, **small-scale development practices**, and **security considerations** for classroom deployment environments.
